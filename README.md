üöÄ `@collinsadi/swagger` is an npm package that automates the generation of Swagger documentation for Express.js applications. Document your routes with ease and share them with your team!

## Installation

You can install this package via npm:

npm install @collinsadi/swagger
```
````

## Usage

### Import the Package

```javascript
const generateSwaggerDocumentation = require("@collinsadi/swagger");
```

### Generate Swagger Documentation

```javascript
// Create an Express app
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Generate Swagger documentation for your Express app
generateSwaggerDocumentation(app, port, live);
```

- `app`: Your Express application.
- `port`: The port on which your server is running.
- `live`: Optional. The deployment server URL.

üëâ **Note:** `@collinsadi/swagger` takes the name of the function assigned to the routes as a description for the route. Currently, it supports routes declared in the `app.js`. Stay tuned for future updates to expand support to routes imported from other files.

### Swagger UI

After generating the Swagger documentation, you can view it using Swagger UI by navigating to:

```
http://your-server/docs
```

### Configuration

You can customize your Swagger documentation by modifying the `config` file.

## Example

```javascript
const liveServer = "https://collinsadi.vercel.app";
generateSwaggerDocumentation(app, 2000, liveServer);
